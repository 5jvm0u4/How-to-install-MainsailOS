# How-to-install-MainsailOS
A internal guide documenting the processes of installing Mainsail on a Raspberry Pi.
## Introduction
Mainsail is a web interface (front end) for klipper, that connects to klipper with an API called moonraker.

[MainsailOS](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/MainsailOS) is a pre-configured image for SBC(Single Board Computer) that include everything mentioned above plus a lot more.

One could install everything by it's own on a linux, and connect everything togather, or thay could install MainsailOS and everything is set.

For a SBC, the latter is recommended. Credit to the [Mainsail-Crew](https://github.com/mainsail-crew)
